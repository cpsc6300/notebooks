    "### Review: Python module and package\n",
    "\n",
    "Python module is an organizational unit of Python code. Python modules have a namespace containing arbitrary Python objects. Python code in one module gains access to the code in another module by the process of importing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has only one type of module object, and all modules are of this type. Considering the large number of modules, Python use the concept of packages to help organize modules and provide a naming hierarchy. You can think of packages as the directories on a file system and modules as files within directories, although packages and modules need not originate from the file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "All modules have a name. Subpackage names are separated from their parent package name by dots, akin to Python’s standard attribute access syntax. Thus you might have a module called sys and a package called email, which in turn has a subpackage called email.mime and a module within that subpackage called email.mime.text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `import` statement is the most common way to import a module. Below are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import math                       # math imported and bounded locally\n",
    "import os.path                    # os.path imported and bounded locally\n",
    "import numpy as np                # numpy imported and bounded as np\n",
    "from bs4 import BeautifulSoup     # bs4 imported bs4.BeautifulSoup as BeautifulSoup\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Executing the basic import statement involves in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. find a module, loading and initializing it if necessary\n",
    "1. define a name or names in the local namespace for the scope where the import statement occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `from` form of the `import` statement involves a slightly more complex process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. find the module specified in the from clause, loading and initializing it if necessary;\n",
    "1. for each of the identifiers specified in the import clauses:\n",
    "   1. check if the imported module has an attribute by that name\n",
    "   1. if not, attempt to import a submodule with that name and then check the imported module again for that attribute\n",
    "   1. if the attribute is not found, ImportError is raised.\n",
    "   1. otherwise, a reference to that value is stored in the local namespace, using the name in the as clause if it is present, otherwise using the attribute name\n",
